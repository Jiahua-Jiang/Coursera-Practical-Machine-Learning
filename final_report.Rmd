Script have been produced and tested on R 3.2.3 and OSX EI Capitan. This Document is the final project for Coursera "Practical Machine Learning" from Johns Hopkins University. Assignement Instructions, Background and Data sections are directly copied from courseâ€™s assignement page.


## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har> (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Data

You can also embed plots, for example:
The training data for this project are available here:

<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv>

The testing data are available here:

<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv>

If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

## Preliminary Work

#### Reproduceability
An overall random number generator seed was set at 12345 for all code. Required packages such as caret, randomForest and rpart were downloaded and installed.

#### How to bulid the model
Our outcome variable is classe, a factor variable with 5 levels. For this data set, participants were asked to perform one set of 10 reprtitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in 5 different fashions:

<span style = "color:blue">Class A: exactly according to the specification</span>

<span style = "color:blue">Class B: throwing the elbows to the front</span>

<span style = "color:blue">Class C: lifting the dumbbell only halfway</span>

<span style = "color:blue">Class D: lowering the dumbbell only halfway</span>

<span style = "color:blue">Class E: throwing the hips to the front</span>

Prediction evaluations are supposed to be based on maximizing the accuracy and minimizing the out-of-sample error. Two models will be tested using decision tree and random forest algorithms. The model with higher accuracy with will be chosen as our final model.

#### Cross-validation
In order to get more convincing result, cross-validation will be performed by subsampling our training data set randomly: subTraining(75%) and subTesting data(25%). The proposed two models will be fitted on the subTraining data set and tested on the subTesting data set. The more accurate one will be chosen to be tested on the original Testing data set.

## Code and Results

#### Preprocessing
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("randomForest")
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("rpart.plot")
```

#### Loading libraries:
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
```


#### Setting the seed for reproduceability:
```{r eval = FALSE}
set.seed(12345)
```

#### Loading data sets and preliminary cleaning:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Loading the training data set into R replacing all missing with "NA":
trainingset <- read.csv("Downloads/pml-training.csv",na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!", ""))

# Loading the testing data set into R replacing all missing with "NA":
testingset <- read.csv("Downloads/pml-testing.csv",na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!", ""))

#Check dimensions for variables and observations:
dim(trainingset)
[1] 19622   160
dim(testingset)
[1]  20 160

# Delete columns with all missing values
trainingset<-trainingset[,colSums(is.na(trainingset)) == 0]
testingset <-testingset[,colSums(is.na(testingset)) == 0]

# Delete irrelevant variables:
names(trainingset)
names(testingset)
trainingset   <-trainingset[,-c(1:7)]
testingset <-testingset[,-c(1:7)]

# Check new data sets(long result will be hidden):
dim(trainingset)
[1] 19622   153
dim(testingset)
[1]  20 153
names(trainingset)
names(testingset)
```


#### Partitioning the training data set
```{r eval = FALSE}
subsamples <- createDataPartition(y=trainingset$classe, p=0.75, list=FALSE)
subTraining <- trainingset[subsamples, ] 
subTesting <- trainingset[-subsamples, ]

dim(subTraining)
[1] 14718   153
dim(subTesting)
[1] 4904  153
```

#### Plot of the data

The variable "classe" contains 5 levels mentioned above: A,B,C,D and E. We draw the picture of the data to see the frequency of each level in subTraining data set.

```{r eval = FALSE}
plot(subTraining$classe, col="orange", main="levels of the variable classe within the subTraining data set", xlab="classe levels", ylab="Frequency")
```

![](/Users/jiahuajiang/Desktop/Desktop/coursera/pratical machine learning/plotofdata.jpg )

From the graph above, we can see that level A is the most frequent while level D is the least frequent.


#### Model train and Validation

At first we will build models: decision tree and random forest  based on the subTraining set and then test them on subTesting set. Finally, we will choose the model with better performance and implement it on Training set.

<span style = "color:red"> Model 1: Decision Tree</span>

```{r eval = FALSE}
model1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=subTraining, method="class")

# Predicting:
pred1 <- predict(model1, subTesting, type = "class")

# Validation on subTesting data set:
confusionMatrix(pred1, subTesting$classe)
```

pml_write_files = function(x) {
    n = length(x)
    for (i in 1:n) {
        filename = paste0("problem_id_", i, ".txt")
        write.table(x[i], file = filename, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE,
